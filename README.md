Devices.css - Modern devices in pure CSS

All devices are elegantly developed in pure CSS. The first are newly announced iPhone X and iPhone 8. More devices are coming. You can use these minimal devices in landing and screenshot showcase pages.

## Devices

- iPhone X (Silver)
- iPhone 8 (Silver, Gold and Space Gray)
- Samsung Galaxy S8 ( Midnight Black and Coral Blue)
- iPad Pro (Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and Space Gray)
- MacBook Pro (Silver and Space Gray)
- Surface Studio
- iMac Pro

## What's next
- Add more devices and form factors
- Add transition effects when change among devices

## Getting started

Download the compiled and minified [Devices.css files](https://github.com/picturepan2/devices.css). Include `devices.css` located in `/dist` in your website or Web app &lt;head&gt; part.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/devices.css">`

Go to [Demo page](https://picturepan2.github.io/devices.css/) to copy the device HTML source code and paste it to anywhere you want.

You can add any content or screenshots to the `device-content`div. The resolution aspect ratios are based on real ones.

## Custom

You can custom Devices.css by modifing SASS `.scss` files located in `src` folder.

## Browser support
Devices.css uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers. For best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

- Chrome (LAST 4)
- Microsoft Edge (LAST 4)
- Firefox (EXTENDED SUPPORT RELEASE)
- Safari (LAST 4)
- Opera (LAST 4)
